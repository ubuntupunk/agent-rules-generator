## üç≥ Recipes & Templates

### Recipe Repository

The tool can fetch recipes from a remote GitHub repository, allowing for easy updates and sharing of project templates. By default, it uses the official recipe repository at [ubuntupunk/agent-rules-recipes](https://github.com/ubuntupunk/agent-rules-recipes).

#### Repository Structure
```
agent-rules-recipes/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ recipes/           # Recipe files (.yaml)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/         # Template files referenced by recipes
```

#### Using a Custom Recipe Repository
You can configure a custom repository by running:
```bash
bun run start
```
Then select "Configure remote repository" and enter your GitHub repository in the format `owner/repo`.

### API Integration

The tool uses the GitHub API to fetch recipes and templates. For optimal performance and to avoid rate limiting, it's recommended to set up a GitHub Personal Access Token.

#### Setting Up GitHub Authentication
1. Create a Personal Access Token:
   - Go to GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Developer Settings ‚Üí Personal Access Tokens ‚Üí Generate new token
   - Select the `public_repo` scope (or `repo` for private repositories)
   - Copy the generated token

2. Configure the token:
   ```bash
   # Temporary (current session only)
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
   
   # Or add to your shell profile (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, etc.)
   echo 'export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

#### Rate Limits
- **Unauthenticated**: 60 requests per hour
- **Authenticated**: 5,000 requests per hour

The tool will show your current rate limit status during operations.

### Recipes
Recipes are pre-configured project type definitions that provide default values for generating agent rules files. They contain metadata about technology stacks, coding standards, and project structures for specific types of projects.

#### Creating Custom Recipes
1. Create a new YAML file in the `recipes` directory of your repository
2. Follow this structure:
   ```yaml
   name: "Project Type Name"
   description: "Description of the project type"
   technologies:
     - "Technology 1"
     - "Technology 2"
   rules:
     - "Rule 1"
     - "Rule 2"
   templates:
     - source: "templates/filename.template"
       target: "{{project_name}}/path/to/output"
   ```
3. Commit and push to your repository
4. The tool will automatically detect new recipes on the next sync

### Templates
Templates are customizable markdown files that serve as the base structure for generated `.agent.md` or `.windsurfrules` files. They allow you to define custom sections and formatting for your AI assistant configuration files.

### Community Contributions

We welcome community contributions for both recipes and templates! Please see more details in Contributing section. If you have a recipe or template that would be useful for others:

1. **For Recipes**: Create a YAML or text file in the `recipes/` directory following the existing format
2. **For Templates**: Add a markdown file to the `templates/` directory with your custom template structure

#### Recipe Format
Recipes should include:
- `name`: Name of the project type
- `description`: Brief description of the project type
- `category`: Category (Frontend, Backend, Full Stack, etc.)
- `tags`: Array of relevant tags
- `techStack`: Object containing technology details (language, frontend, backend, etc.)

#### Template Format
Templates are markdown files with placeholders for dynamic content. See existing templates in the `templates/` directory for examples.

#### Submitting Recipe Contributions
Please see more details in Contributing section. You wil need to fork the recipe repository [ubuntupunk/agent-rules-recipes](https://github.com/ubuntupunk/agent-rules-recipes) and submit a pull request.

## üöÄ Development

### Setup Development Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd agent-rules-generator

# Install dependencies with Bun
bun install

# Run in development mode
bun run start
```

### Available Scripts

```bash
# Start the application
bun run start

# Run tests
bun test

# Lint code
bun run lint

# Format code with Prettier
bun run format

# Prepare husky hooks
bun run prepare
```

## üß™ Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
bun test

# Run tests with coverage
bun test --coverage
```

## üì¶ Building

The project is ready to run without a build step. For distribution:

```bash
# Create a production-ready package
bun run prepare
```

## üì° Deployment

The project is set up with a GitHub Action that automatically deploys and publishes the package to the default npm registry when a new tag is pushed. To trigger deployment:

1. Create a new tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
2. Push the tag to the remote repository: `git push origin v1.0.0`

Ensure you have set up the `NPM_TOKEN` secret in your GitHub repository settings with the necessary npm publish permissions. The GitHub Action will use this token to authenticate with the npm registry.
