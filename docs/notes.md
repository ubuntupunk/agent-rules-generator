# Notes

- Missing Template Engine: The current code doesnâ€™t include a templating engine (e.g., Handlebars) to process complex templates. The example replacePlaceholders function above is a basic implementation. For more complex templates, consider integrating a library like Handlebars or Mustache.
- Template Naming: The loadTemplate function expects templates to be named <templateName>.md. Ensure the templateName matches what you pass to loadTemplate (e.g., agent-template for agent-template.md).
- Windsurf Template: If you want to use templates for .windsurfrules, create a similar template (e.g., windsurf-template.md) and ensure generateAgentFile handles it appropriately.

## Additional Considerations

- Error Handling: If a template is malformed or missing placeholders, add validation to ensure all required config fields are present.
- Extending Templates: You can create multiple templates for different project types or tech stacks and prompt the user to select one in agent_rules_cli.js.
- Recipe Integration: Templates could be paired with recipes (from recipes_lib.js) to provide pre-configured setups for common tech stacks.
