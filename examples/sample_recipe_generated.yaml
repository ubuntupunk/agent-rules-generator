  # React TypeScript Project Rules

  ## Component Guidelines
  - Use functional components with hooks
  - Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for props
  - Follow the single responsibility principle
  - Use descriptive component and prop names

  ## Code Organization
  - Group related components in feature folders
  - Separate business logic into custom hooks
  - Use absolute imports with path mapping
  - Keep components under 200 lines

  ## Performance
  - Use React.memo for expensive components
  - Implement proper dependency arrays in useEffect
  - Lazy load routes and heavy components
  - Optimize bundle size with code splitting

  ## Testing
  - Write unit tests for all custom hooks
  - Test component behavior, not implementation
  - Use data-testid for reliable element selection
  - Maintain >80% test coverage
